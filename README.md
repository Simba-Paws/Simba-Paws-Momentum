# Simba-Paws-Momentum

This is a Build-To-Learn Project created by a 3-person team of "student" web-developers participating in the [Chingu Cohorts](https://tropicalchancer.github.io/projectus/). During the course of this project, we practiced pair programming and collaboration while working on a "clone" of some of the major features found in the popular [Momentum Chrome Extension](https://momentumdash.com/).

## Want to try it out?

Our project currently exists only on GitHub (it is *not* available as a Chrome extension in the Chrome web store). It is a student project that is *not* particularly well-maintained. However, if you *do* wish to see our work-in-progress, here's how you can run the extension on your own computer:

1. Download the code onto your computer. This can be done using the green "Clone or download" button on the left side of screen, just above the files section.

2. In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions`.

3. Drag-and-drop the extension folder from your computer into the extensions section in Chrome.

4. If Developer mode is not enabled, enable it using the checkbox in the upper right corner of the screen.

5. Open a new tab!

## Built with...

This project is built with jQuery, and uses Fontawesome fonts, as well as images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a daily quote from [They Said So](https://theysaidso.com), and weather from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.com).

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to Chance for organizing the Chingu Cohorts and providing this opportunity us to learn web development together!
